This repo is no longer maintained. 

All efforts are now in [SharpDevelopMVC4](https://github.com/aspdotnetgabs/sharpdevelopmvc), a light-weight solid starting point for developing a **unified** ASP.NET MVC and Web API application in [portable](https://portable.info.pl/sharpdevelop-portable/) [SharpDevelop](https://mega.nz/file/sJIHBbyY#O80dgllefCf07TIesoM1IMxsTqomVhLVt6_t9WG-hXA). Great for student learning and small medium size projects!
